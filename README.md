#Flux: Seed Project

This is a seed project for you to get started developing Flux apps with the web SDK.
Included in this project is a 3D viewport for viewing geometry data from Flux, an input slider, and an output display.
The application logic is contained in js/index.js, and the SDK calls in js/helpers.js.
